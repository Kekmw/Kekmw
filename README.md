### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Kek here

I'm still learning how to code, I focus on learning JS. I like the learning new stuff and I have a habit of asking from the people more better then me and get advice. I currently help out a [wiki](https://wiki.krew.io). You can find me here in my [Discord](https://discord.gg/46GrXNc9mU).
